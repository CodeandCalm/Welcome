 Welcome! 

I'm Tatiana, and I'm quite interested in how our brains work and how technology can interact with them ⚡
This repository is my little corner of GitHub to tinker with some ideas and learn more about this fascinating field.

✨ Soo What's here? ✨

Not much yet, honestly . I'm just starting out and figuring things out as I go ⭐

✨ What can you do? ✨

* Take a peek! I'm always happy to share what I'm working on, even if it's messy.
* Ask questions! ❓ There are no experts here, just curious minds!
* Let me know if you have any ideas! Maybe we can learn and explore together ️

Remember: I'm a complete GitHub newbie , so any pointers or advice are greatly appreciated!
